# CarFinder
Final Project for CS411

# Purpose
As current and former members of RSO’s (Registered Student Organizations) on campus we found that coordinating travel arrangements can be quite a cumbersome experience for many groups. Most RSO’s are not funded well enough to have the school coordinate their travel so they must do it themselves, often times utilizing their own personal vehicles. Currently there is no way of automating this process and teams are left to create google forms and manually figure out who should ride with which driver in which car. That is what our project aimed to handle. 

Our project utilizes MySQL databases and a web interface to determine the best passengers for each available driver and dynamically arranges passengers based on driver preference, sub-team preference, and size of vehicles. Along with this the application can also determine the per-available vehicle fuel cost to each available event for an organization based on the cars combined MPG.
